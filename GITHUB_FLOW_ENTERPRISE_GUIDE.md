## üîÑ GitHub Flow Overview

### Core Principles
- **Main branch is always deployable** - Production-ready code only
- **Feature branches for all changes** - No direct commits to main
- **Pull requests for code review** - Mandatory peer review process
- **Automated testing required** - All tests must pass before merge
- **Descriptive commit messages** - Clear history and documentation

### Enterprise Benefits
- **Reduced Risk** - Isolated development prevents production issues
- **Quality Assurance** - Mandatory reviews and automated testing
- **Audit Trail** - Complete history of changes and approvals
- **Team Collaboration** - Structured review and discussion process
- **Compliance** - Meets SOX, GDPR, and other regulatory requirements

## üå≥ Branch Management

### Branch Naming Conventions

#### **Feature Branches**
```
feature/descriptive-name
feature/user-authentication
feature/payment-integration
feature/dashboard-analytics
```

#### **Bug Fix Branches**
```
bugfix/issue-description
bugfix/login-error-handling
bugfix/memory-leak-fix
bugfix/api-timeout-issue
```

#### **Hotfix Branches** (Critical Production Issues)
```
hotfix/critical-security-patch
hotfix/production-outage-fix
hotfix/data-corruption-repair
```

#### **Release Branches** (If using release cycles)
```
release/v1.2.0
release/2024-q1-release
release/major-feature-launch
```

### Branch Management Commands

#### **Creating Feature Branch**
```bash
# Start from latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b feature/enterprise-workflow-improvements

# Push branch to remote and set upstream
git push -u origin feature/enterprise-workflow-improvements
```

#### **Keeping Branch Updated**
```bash
# Regular sync with main (recommended daily)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/your-feature
git merge main  # or git rebase main for cleaner history

# Push updates
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

#### **Branch Cleanup**
```bash
# After PR is merged, clean up local branches
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/your-feature  # Delete local branch
git remote prune origin              # Clean up remote references
```

## üìù Commit Standards

### Conventional Commits Format
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types (Enterprise Standard)

#### **Primary Types**
- `feat:` - New feature for users
- `fix:` - Bug fix for users
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code formatting (no logic changes)
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring (no feature/bug changes)
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `test:` - Adding or modifying tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks, dependency updates

#### **Enterprise-Specific Types**
- `security:` - Security-related changes
- `compliance:` - Regulatory compliance updates
- `infra:` - Infrastructure changes
- `config:` - Configuration updates
- `deploy:` - Deployment-related changes

### Commit Examples

#### **Good Commit Messages**
```bash
feat(auth): implement multi-factor authentication

- Add TOTP support using authenticator apps
- Integrate with corporate LDAP directory
- Include backup codes for account recovery
- Update security policy documentation

Closes #1234
Reviewed-by: Security-Team
```

```bash
fix(api): resolve timeout issues in payment processing

- Increase connection timeout to 30 seconds
- Add retry logic for transient failures
- Improve error handling and user feedback
- Add monitoring for payment API performance

Fixes #5678
Security-Impact: None
```

#### **Poor Commit Messages (Avoid)**
```bash
# Too vague
fix: bug fix
update: changes
misc: stuff

# No context
WIP
tmp
test

# Not descriptive
fixed it
updated files
changes
```

### Commit Best Practices

#### **Atomic Commits**
- One logical change per commit
- All tests should pass after each commit
- Related files should be committed together

#### **Commit Message Guidelines**
```bash
# Use imperative mood (command form)
‚úÖ "Add user authentication"
‚ùå "Added user authentication"
‚ùå "Adding user authentication"

# Be specific and descriptive
‚úÖ "Fix memory leak in image processing pipeline"
‚ùå "Fix bug"

# Reference issues and PRs
‚úÖ "Closes #123, Fixes #456"
‚úÖ "Related to #789"
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### **Merge Conflicts**
```bash
# Resolve merge conflicts
git checkout feature/your-branch
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main

# Resolve conflicts manually, then:
git add .
git commit -m "resolve: merge conflicts with main"
git push origin feature/your-branch
```

#### **Failed Status Checks**
```bash
# Re-run failed checks
gh workflow run ci.yml --ref feature/your-branch

# Debug locally
npm test          # Run tests locally
npm run lint      # Check linting
npm run build     # Verify build
```

#### **PR Blocked by Reviews**
```markdown
Review Process Issues:
- Ping reviewers in Slack if >48 hours
- Break large PRs into smaller ones
- Add more context in PR description
- Request specific feedback on concerns
- Escalate to team lead if needed
```

### Emergency Procedures

#### **Hotfix Process**
```bash
# Emergency production fix
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-security-patch

# Make minimal fix
git add .
git commit -m "hotfix: patch critical security vulnerability"
git push -u origin hotfix/critical-security-patch

# Create emergency PR
gh pr create --title "HOTFIX: Critical Security Patch" \
  --body "Emergency fix for production security issue" \
  --assignee @security-team \
  --reviewer @tech-lead,@security-team \
  --label "hotfix,critical,security"
```

#### **Rollback Procedures**
```bash
# Revert problematic merge
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-sha>
git push origin main

# Create rollback PR
gh pr create --title "revert: rollback problematic deployment" \
  --body "Rolling back changes causing production issues"
```
