RAG System Implementation Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) 
system implemented for the AI Career Mentor Chatbot. This represents a significant 
enhancement that transforms the chatbot from a general-purpose AI assistant into a 
specialized, knowledge-enhanced career guidance system.

## üéØ System Overview

The RAG system combines the power of Azure Cognitive Search with Azure OpenAI to create 
responses that are both accurate and grounded in domain-specific knowledge. Unlike standard 
AI responses that rely solely on training data, our RAG system retrieves relevant information 
from a curated knowledge base and uses it to inform response generation.
