- ✅ All Azure resources exist and are healthy
- ✅ Container App is running and accessible
- ✅ Security configurations are correct
- ✅ Network connectivity works
- ✅ Health endpoints respond correctly

### **3. Advanced Troubleshooting Tools**
```bash
# Complete infrastructure diagnostics
./infrastructure/scripts/troubleshoot.sh diagnostics --verbose

# Real-time monitoring
./infrastructure/scripts/troubleshoot.sh monitor

# Application logs streaming
./infrastructure/scripts/troubleshoot.sh logs --watch

# Infrastructure health checks
./infrastructure/scripts/troubleshoot.sh health
```

### **4. Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline**
- **Automated**: Complete deployment without manual intervention
- **Validated**: Every deployment is automatically validated
- **Resilient**: Built-in retry and recovery mechanisms
- **Monitored**: Comprehensive logging and error reporting

## 📋 Deployment Options

### **Option 1: Automated CI/CD (Recommended)**
Simply push code to GitHub - the enhanced pipeline handles everything:

1. **Automated Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, security scans
2. **Container Building**: Docker image creation and registry push
3. **Infrastructure Deployment**: Three-phase robust deployment
4. **Validation**: Automatic health checks and validation
5. **Monitoring**: Application insights and error tracking

### **Option 2: Local Deployment**
For development or troubleshooting:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd ai-powered-chatbot

# Run robust deployment
./infrastructure/scripts/deploy-robust.sh \
  --environment dev \
  --subscription "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID" \
  --admin-email "your-email@example.com" \
  --verbose

# Validate deployment
./infrastructure/scripts/validate-deployment.sh --environment dev
```

### **Option 3: Manual Step-by-Step**
For learning or debugging:

```bash
# Phase 1: Minimal (core services)
az deployment group create --resource-group rg-ai-career-mentor-dev \
  --template-file infrastructure/bicep/main.bicep \
  --parameters deploymentMode=minimal

# Phase 2: Infrastructure (add Container Apps Environment)
az deployment group create --resource-group rg-ai-career-mentor-dev \
  --template-file infrastructure/bicep/main.bicep \
  --parameters deploymentMode=infrastructure

# Phase 3: Full (complete deployment)
az deployment group create --resource-group rg-ai-career-mentor-dev \
  --template-file infrastructure/bicep/main.bicep \
  --parameters deploymentMode=full
```
